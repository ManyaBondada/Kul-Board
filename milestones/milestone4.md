## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The team was able to refocus on developing the MVP and clearly delineated tasks, showcasing a deeper understanding of how the frontend and backend connect. Both members effectively communicated their code to each other, enhancing teamwork and project flow. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had a short period of time to finish our issues for milestone 4, so we needed to find common times in order to host calls for debugging and general development. We decided to allocate some time in the evenings to address this challenge.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We were not able to finish all of the tasks in our sprint plan for this week, as we could not finish the task management feature. However, we aim to prioritize this task by completing it starting day 1 of week 9, as other features build on this. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We consider the admin's user story of monitoring user activity and the family member's user story of receiving notifications of tasks to be at risk. However, these stories were not included in our MVP, as we viewed them more as stretch features. Our plan to complete the MVP and associated features remains on track, but after Demo Day, we would like to continue working to implement stretch features.  

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

At this time, we do not need any additional support and we look forward to receiving more information on deployment.
