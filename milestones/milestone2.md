## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, both members spent time understanding each other's technical strengths, weaknesses, and interests. This step was crucial in order to better delegate work and find out which features may need additional support/time to complete. We realized that both members had a diverse set of skills that could be leveraged intelligently to complete the project more efficiently.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The biggest challenge our team faced was ensuring that we shared the same understanding of how our app should flow. One person worked on the ER diagrams while another person focused on the wireframes, but both members still needed to double-check that the diagrams utilized the same design logic. During this process, differences in interpretation of how the app should look or function were highlighted and effectively communicated. Thus, the team was able to reach a deeper technical consensus on the app's functionality.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

No additional support is needed.
