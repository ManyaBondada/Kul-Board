## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

This week, our team spent a lot of time discussing user stories and features that might benefit our app's target audience, which not only gave us a clearer vision for our web app, but also facilitated team communication and bonding. Overall, we enjoyed the process of brainstorming ideas, elaborating on each other's thoughts, and pondering solutions to daily problems.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Both group members had come up with ideas for this web app, so there was a bit of deliberation on which topic to choose. In the end, we made our topic decision by discussing our personal goals for this project; all members wanted to prioritize developing backend technical skills within and outside the scope of this course, and only one of the projects placed emphasis on this. As a result, we were able to overcome this challenge by assessing each individual's goals and clearly defining team priorities.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We believe that the guidelines have thus far provided a comprehensive list of resources. However, it would be nice to discuss progress and check back in with our previous pod mates, as their feedback could provide valuable insights on how we can improve our project.
