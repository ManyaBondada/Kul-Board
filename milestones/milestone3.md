## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We made significant progress in our understanding of version control systems, particularly in the context of project management.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We encountered a few challenges, such as figuring out how to grant admin privileges to all group members, discovering that only the repository owner can create project boards, and realizing that the repo owner needs to enable the issue feature.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Unfortunately, we couldn't start as planned due to exams for both group members. However, we are determined to catch up next week. We have already established a clear plan of who will do what and when. Once the exam week is over, we can refocus on our project.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Fortunately, we have a well-defined plan for our minimal viable product, which makes everything still seem achievable.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Currently, we are uncertain about the specific support we will need. However, we are aware that CodePath mentors are always available to assist us.
